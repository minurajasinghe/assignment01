%Function that computes the collision time for a thrown egg
%INPUTS:
%traj_fun: a function that describes the [x,y,theta] trajectory
% of the egg (takes time t as input)
%egg_params: a struct describing the hyperparameters of the oval
%y_ground: height of the ground
%x_wall: position of the wall
%OUTPUTS:
%t_ground: time that the egg would hit the ground
%t_wall: time that the egg would hit the wall
function [t_ground,t_wall] = collision_func(traj_fun, egg_params, y_ground, x_wall)
